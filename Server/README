Hi, welcome to my Hawbutique site's server side!

In order to run this project you should run the next commands:
    npm install
    npm run dev
If you want to run it in your browser (excepr from the site) go to 'http://localhost:3080/'

This project is the server side of my client side project - אתר הבוטיק- איפור וטיפוח

When start runnimg the first page that beggins to run is the 'index.js',
there we create a socket that would listen to port 3080.

This is the functionality of the pp
When the user selects one of the categories, the GET function bring the items of this category from the mongoDB and show it on the screen.
each product is in the fit collection in mongo - face/lips/eyes.
The site has another channel of tips. This tips is also readen from mongoDB by GET function.

When finishing his shopping, and insert his own details and the way he wants to pay, the user submit the purchase.
then the POST function send all the details to the MongoDb, so the company would know to tace care of it.
After posting to mongoDB, an email message sent to the client.


The relevant functions in the client side is:
    useEffect - in product.js
    useEffect - in tips.js
    addRespond, sendingSuccessEmail - in patmentPage, Finish component

Enjoy it!!
Thanks
